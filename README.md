# Business Problem :

# What i have done :

2. How they their business in diffrent countries.
3. Used Python libraries in googlecolab why because Easy to view and know the info and easy to clean the data and can also see data visualy using matplotlib and seaborn.
4. I have done
   -> Non-Graphical Analysis
   -> Visual Analysis - Univariate, Bivariate
5. Given Business Insights and Recommendations.
   
## Business Insights:
1. Missing values in Director, Cast, Country, and Date Added can negatively impact user experience.
2. The "Duration" column shows 1 season as the most frequent value, which doesnâ€™t provide users with clear information about the content's length .
3. Duplicate entries lead to discrepancies between count and unique records in the dataset.
4. A significant number of movies and shows were produced in 2018, followed by a decline in production in subsequent years.
5. International movies are highly popular both in movies and TV shows, indicating a strong preference for global content.
6. The dataset shows that movies are more numerous than TV shows, suggesting a stronger preference for movies.
7. TV-MA is the dominant rating, suggesting a mature audience preference for movies.
8. Missing information (e.g., Director, Cast) can be filled using third-party sources like IMDB, enhancing content metadata.

## Recommendations:
1. Fill missing Director and Cast data by pulling from third-party sources or using a default "missing" value.
2. Address missing Country data for better content discoverability in different markets.
3. Standardize duration data by showing actual runtime (hours/minutes for movies) or episode counts for TV shows. This helps users assess time commitment and enhances user satisfaction.
4. Remove duplicates and clean the dataset regularly to ensure data consistency.This improves search accuracy and enhances content recommendations.
5. Revisit reasons behind the decline in production and adjust strategy accordingly.
6. Invest in and promote international content due to its high viewership.
7. Focus on promoting more movies while balancing TV shows to maintain long-term engagement
8. Create region-based categories, collaborate with international production houses, and target marketing efforts in specific regions
9. Integrate third-party APIs (e.g., IMDB) to automatically fill missing Director, Cast, and Country data.
10. Expand international content offerings and highlight it in recommendations.
